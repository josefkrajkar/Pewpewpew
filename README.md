# [Pew! Pew! Pew!](http://pewpew.surge.sh/)

This is a simple game made in React JS. There is a lot to improve, but the game is already playable and challenging :)

**How to install the example**

Clone the repository into your harddrive and then just run ```npm install``` and ```npm start``` to run it. You can also check the static example on [this link](http://pewpew.surge.sh).

**How to play:**

<p>To move the blue square just move the mouse cursor over the play area. You can fire your weapon once every 500 miliseconds to destroy the large red squares (+ 30 pts).
You can let the red square pass (+ 10 pts), but don't let it hit you (game-over). If you will catch the small green square, you will get bonus of 100 points. If you will catch the small black square, you will lose 100 points. Let me know if you will get more than 2000 pts ;)</p>

**How to use "Pew! Pew! Pew!" in your project:**

- Please, make sure you imported pewpew.js and pewpew.css into your project
- use ```<Game/>``` tag in your webpage
- Play the game! :)

If you'll have any questions or suggestions about this script or just want to say "Hello!", please send me an email, I will really appreciate it as well as any contributions :)

Thank you for your time and "May the Code be with you"!
