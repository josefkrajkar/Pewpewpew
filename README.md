# [Pew! Pew! Pew!](http://pewpew.surge.sh/)

This is a simple game made in React JS. It is still a little bit WIP, but already playable and challenging :)

**How to play:**

<p>To move the blue square just move the mouse cursor over the play area. You can fire your weapon once every 500 miliseconds to destroy the large red squares (+ 30 pts).
You can let the red square pass (+ 10 pts), but don't let it hit you (game-over). If you will catch the small green square, you will get bonus of 100 points. If you will catch the small black square, you will lose 100 points. Let me know if you will get more than 2000 pts ;)</p>

**How to use "Pew! Pew! Pew!" in your project:**

- Please, make sure you imported pewpew.js and pewpew.css into your project
- use ```<Game/>``` tag in your webpage
- Play the game! :)
